This is a resource-trading game I created for CS 202 at PSU, which is an introduction to object oriented programming in C++.
The game has three different societies, each with their own resources and money system. There isn't necessarily an endgame or ultimate objective, but 
the player can harvest and trade resources across the societies. 

The game can be run through a standard c++ terminal procedure: 
$ make (assuming g++ is installed)
$./main
Then the game will go through some setup (naming societies). 

The game probably has some bugs, but was done quickly as a school project, and worked well so I am hosting it.
